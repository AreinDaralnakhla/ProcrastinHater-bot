I've been procrastinating quite a bit recently, so I created ProcrastinHater.

ProcrastinHater is a study companion LEGO bot that monitors your environment and holds you accountable. At the start of a session, the user inputs their study focus topic—such as algebra—into the script. If the bot detects irrelevant content, like gaming videos or casual conversations, it responds immediately with visual and sound cues as a warning.

To add a personal touch, ProcrastinHater sends notifications via LINE with motivating or guilt-inducing reminders to refocus on the task at hand.

Setup:
To build the bot, you’ll need a General GPIO, LED Meshes, and an IFTTT account.
If you only need the functionality, clone this repo, install the required packages, add your Google Speech-to-Text and OpenAI API keys, and run audio_checker.py.
